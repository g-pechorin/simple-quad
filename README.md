# Stoopid-Quad Buffered GLFW3 example

This is a [quad-buffered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering#Quad_buffering) example program written against [GLFW3/OpenGL](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html#quick_example).
(GLSE 2? GLSE 3? whatever - nobody notices the desktop version's changes)

If it doesn't work - your graphics card might not allow quad-buffering.
